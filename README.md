# Burgers

This app is meant to create a basic outline of an app which can do the following:
* create a burger that can be typed in by the user
* 'devour' a burger of the user's choosing when the user clicks the corresponding button
* recreate a burger once the user clicks the button to remake the burger.

Currently there are issues in deploying to heroku, but the code is all there.
